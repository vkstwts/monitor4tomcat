A set of monitoring scripts for Apache Tomcat.

These scripts can help your Apache Tomcat application to continue to run in the face of OutOfMemory exceptions or other un-expected exceptions.

Please read the [project documentation](Monitor4Tomcat.md) for an idea of how the monitor works.

Due to Apache legal concerns the name of the "tomcat-monitor" project was renamed to "monitor4tomcat" project.  This project, monitor4tomcat, replaces the previous "tomcat-monitor" project.
